###  principles of reliable data transfer

-  channel model
-  realistic assumptions
-  protocol mechanisms

**reliable service implementation**

```
[sending process][data] 
----application transport--->
[sender-side of reliable data transfer protocol]
----transport network--->
[unreliable channel]
----transport network--->
[receiver-side of reliable data transfer protocol]
----application transport--->
[receiving process][data]
```

**`[sender-side of relaible data transfer protocol]` and `[receiver-side of reliable data transfer protocol]`**

-  complexity of reliable data transfer protocol will depend strongly on characteristics of unreliable channel (lose, corrupt, reorder data?
-  sender, receiver do not know the state of each other, e.g. was a message received?
    +  unless communicated via a message

-  **`rdt_send()`**  called from above (e.g. by app) passed data to deliver to receiver upper level
-  **`udt_send()`**  called by `rdt` to transfer packet over unreliable channel to receiver
-  **`rdt_rcv()`**  called when a packet arrives on receiv er side of channel
-  **`deliver_data()`** called by `rdt` to deliver data to upper layer


###  reliable data transfer:  getting started

-  we will incrementally develop send,er receiver sides of reliable data transfer protocol (`rdt`)
-  consider only unidirectional data transfer
    +  but control info will flow in both directions
-  use finite state machines (FSM) to specify sender, receiver

-  what do we really mean when we say RDT senders in a given state or a receiver is in a given state?
-  think about a link being transmitting state or in an idle state
-  think about the notion of there being transitions between states
-  transitions are happening because of an event that takes place
-  think about actions that are taken by the system

###  `rdt1.0`:  reliable transfer over a reliable channel

-  underlying channel is perfectly reliable
    +  no bit errors
    +  no loss of packets
-  separate FSMS for sender, receiver
    +  sender sends data into underlying channel
    +  receiver reads data from underlying channel

**finite state machine figure**

**sender** [wait for call from above] 

`rdt_send(data)`, `packet = make_pkt(data)`, `udt_send(packet)`

**receiver** [wait for call from below]

`rdt_rcv(packet)`, `extract(packet, data)`, `deliver_data(data)`

###  `rdt2.0`:  channel with bit errors

-  underlying channel may flip bits in packet
    +  checksum to detect bit errors
-  the question:  how to recover from errors
    +  acknowledgements (ACKs): receiver explicitly tells sender that pkt received OK
    +  negative acknowledgements (NAKs):  receiver explicitly tells sender that pkt had errors
    +  sender retransmits pkt on receipt of NAK

**stop and wait**

-  sender sends one packet, then waits for receiver response

```
[wait for call from above] -----> [wait for ACK or NAK]
^                                                     |
|_____________________________________________________|
```

###  `rdt2.0` has a fatal flaw

-  what happens if ack / nak corrupted?
    +  sender doesnt know what happened at receiver
    +  can't just retransmit: possible duplicate

**handling duplicates**
-  sender retransmits current pkt if ACK/NAK corrupted
-  sender adds sequence number to each pkt
-  receiver discards (doesn't deliver up) duplicate pkt

**stop and wait**
-  sender sneds one packet, then waits for receiver response

###  `rdt2.1`  discussion

**sender**
-  sequence number added to pkt
-  two sequences numbers (0, 1) will suffice
-  must check of received ACK/NAK corrupted
-  twice as many states
    +  state must remember whether expected pkt should have sequence number of 0 or 1

**receiver**
-  must check of received packet is duplicate
    +  state indicates whether 0 or 1 is expected pkt sequence number
-  note: receiver can not know if its last ACK/NAK received okay at sender

###  rdt protocol mechanisms
-  error detection (e.g. checksum)
-  acks, naks
-  retransmission
-  sequence numbers (duplicate detection)
