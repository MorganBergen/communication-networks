**1.  what are the differences between the client-server approach and the peer-to-peer approach?**

the client server approach involves a centralized architecture where servers provide resources and services, and clients request them making it easier to manage and secure but potentially harder to scale.  In contrast peer to peer approach is decentralized, with each peer acting as both a client and a server.  this makes p2p more scalable and resilient to failures but more challenging to manage and secure due to the lack of central control.

**2.  what are the differences between tcp and udp?**

tcp transmission control protocol is a connection oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission with error checking, data recovery, and flow control, making it suitable for applications where accuracy is crucial, like web browsing and email.  in contrast udp user diagram protocol is connectionless and focuses on speed over reliability, with no error checking or recovery, making it ideal for real time applications like video streaming and online gaming where occasional data loss is acceptable.

**3.  what is http and what is its primary purpose in the context of the world wide web?**

http is a protocol used for transferring hypertext documents on the world wide web.  its primary purpose is to enable communication between web clients and web servers, facilitating the retrieval and display of web pages and other resources.

**4.  what is the purpose of a cookie in computer networking?**

a cookie is a small piece of data stored on a users device by a web browser while browsing a website.  cookies are used to remember information about the user, such as login status, preferences, and tracking user behavior across different sessions and websites.  they help improve the user experience and provide personalized content.

**5.  can you mention some application layer protocols and transport layer protocols?**

-  smtp - simple mail transfer protocol
-  imap -  internet message access protocols
-  pop3 -  post office protocol version 3

transport layer protocol
-  tcp - transmission control protocol
