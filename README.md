###  textbook

[computer networking: a top-down approach, 7th edition, by kurose and ross](https://www.ucg.ac.me/skladiste/blog_44233/objava_64433/fajlovi/Computer%20Networking%20_%20A%20Top%20Down%20Approach,%207th,%20converted.pdf)

###  description

an introduction to the principles used in communication networks is given.  topics include discussion used of communications networks, network traffic, network impairments, standards, layered reference models for organizing network functions.  local area network technology and protocols are discussed.  link, network, transport layer protocols, and security are introduced.  TCP/IP networks are stressed.  basic concepts of network performance evaluation and wireless communications are studied.  both analytical and simulation techniques are considered.

###  topics

1.  basics of data communication and network architecture
2.  network layer control and protocol
3.  link layer control and protocols
4.  TCP/IP protocol suite
5.  high speed LANs
6.  internetworking technologies
7.  design advanced communication protocols
